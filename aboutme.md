Hello and welcome to my blog! My name's Alex and I'm a Data Scientist at [Vendelux](https://https://vendelux.com//) where I work somewhere at the intersection of ML and backend and AI engineering.

Before this I was an [Insight Fellow](https://www.insightdatascience.com/), worked at Simulmedia, and Bloomfire, and did a PhD in math at Washington University in St. Louis. During my PhD I focused on problems in discrete geometry, combinatorics, and graph theory. 

I started this blog as a way to document my journey into the nebulous world of "data science" and as a way to learn. Now that I work in the industry I hope to continue using this as a way to explore novel and exciting ways in which science and data influence our everyday lives. I am especially interested in using interactive visualizations to facilitate better understanding of complex datasets and of complex processes in math and machine learning. I am also interested in AI engineering and LLM orchestration.

I do most of the analysis you see in:  

- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, numpy in jupyter notebooks)
- R (tidyr/dplyr/data.table %>% ggplot2/htmlwidgets %<>% caret %>% Rmarkdown/Shiny) (I haven't used R in a few years :()
- SageMath (for pure math stuff)

I also try to keep my blog posts as reproducible as possible. You check out my code on [Github](https://github.com/apapiu?tab=repositories).

I have also been known to ride bikes, eat tacos, take [photos](http://alexpapiu.tumblr.com), play guitar, and think about urbanism.

If you have any questions comments or suggestions shot me an email or say hi on [twitter](https://twitter.com/apapiu) or [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/apapiu). The various way to contact me are at the bottom of the page. 

Thanks for stopping by!
